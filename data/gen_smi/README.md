### Data Structure

1. **Target Active Molecules**: The files `aa2ar.csv`, `sars.csv`, and `rock1.csv` contain SMILES representations of active molecules for each target.

2. **Generated Molecules by Baseline Models**: The following six files contain molecules generated by two baseline models for the three targets. Each file includes a `['SMILES']` column:
   - `syn_sars.csv`
   - `bbar_sars.csv`
   - `syn_aa2ar.csv`
   - `bbar_aa2ar.csv`
   - `syn_rock.csv`
   - `bbar_rock.csv`

3. **Protein Files**: There are 60,000 protein files in total, each generated by either `clickgen` or `clickgen-inpainting`. For each of the three targets, there are 10,000 molecules per model. Each file is annotated with properties such as synthesis steps, scores, synthetic intermediates, ligand efficiency (LE), and similarity to active molecules.
